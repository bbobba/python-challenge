# PYTHON CHALLENGE: PyPoll
"""SEE END OF FILE FOR SOLUTION ; EDIT & DELETE"""
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# REQUIREMENTS

# Goal:
#   Create a Python script for analyzing election data. See GitHub for details: https://github.com/bbobba/UTAUS201810DATA2/tree/master/03_Python/Homework/Instructions
#   In this challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. (Up until now, Uncle Cleetus had been trustfully tallying them one-by-one, but unfortunately, his concentration isn't what it used to be.) 

# Dataset: 
#   Poll data stored in a csv called election_data.csv. 
#   The dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`.

# Calculate:
#   The total number of votes cast
#   A complete list of candidates who received votes
#   The percentage of votes each candidate won
#   The total number of votes each candidate won
#   The winner of the election based on popular vote.

# Deliverables:
#   Print the analysis to the terminal
#   Export a text file with the results

# Import the necessary dependencies for os.path.join()

# Open and read the csv file
